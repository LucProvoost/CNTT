### 8.4.1 Adoption Strategy

It is vitally important for CNTT to have working NFVI solutions from NFVI vendors and mature VNFs/CNFs designs from application vendors that is compliant to CNTT specifications. It is also understood that, in some areas, the industry might not have solutions that are fully aligned with CNTT requirements. Therefore, a strategy, comprised of one or more compromises/Exceptions and/or transitions is required to address technology that does not presently conform to CNTT mandates, and hence requires explicit direction to prescribe how the situation will be treated in the present, as well as in the future. 

This informs application designers how RC and ultimately OVP will react when encountering such technologies during the qualification process, including flagging warnings and potentially errors which could prevent issuance of an OVP badge.
