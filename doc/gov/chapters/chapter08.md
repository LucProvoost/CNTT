### 8.4.1 Adoption Strategy

It is vitally important for CNTT to have working NFVI solutions from NFVI vendors and mature VNFs/CNFs designs from application vendors that is compliant to CNTT specifications. It is also understood that, in some areas, the industry might not have solutions that are fully aligned with CNTT requirements. Therefore, an evolution or transitional strategy, comprised of one or more compromises/Exceptions and/or transitions is required to address technology that does not presently conform to CNTT mandates, and hence requires explicit direction to prescribe how the situation will be treated in the present, as well as in the future. 

This strategy will inform application designers how RC and ultimately OVP will react when encountering such technologies during the qualification process, including flagging warnings and potentially errors which could prevent issuance of an OVP badge.

The Adoption Strategy has the following elements (as shown in **Figure 3** below):
- A VNF/CNF Generation
- Exceptions/Compromises List.
- Dates (Time Points)

As Technology evolves and the infrastructure evolves with it, Less and less of exceptions/compromises will be needed and hence the Generation of VNFs/CNFs is expected to evolve with it until VNFs/CNFs are completely compliant to CNTT as shown in **Figure 4** below.

### 8.4.2 VNF Evolution Generations

**Non-Conformant**: (Non-Conformant): None are aligned.

**Gen1**: (Consistent): Going to the right direction but still lots of work to do.

**Gen2**: (Compliant): Many aspects are aligned

**Gen3**: (Conformant): Most aspects are aligned

**Gen4**: (Fully Conformant): All items are aligned.

### 8.4.3 CNF Evolution Generations

**Non-Conformant**: (Non-Conformant): None are aligned.

**Gen1**: (Consistent): Going to the right direction but still lots of work to do.

**Gen2**: (Compliant): Many aspects are aligned

**Gen3**: (Conformant): Most aspects are aligned

**Gen4**: (Fully Conformant): All items are aligned.
